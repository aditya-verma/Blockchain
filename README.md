# Blockchain
This project is for my completion of 6th semester Distributed Systems course. The aim is to store Image based certificates such as University marksheets, or any other type of visual certificate and store them on Immutable and Distributed blocks chained together in form of hash.

## Steps to setup
* Clone the repository on your local machine
* Install requirements.txt
* Run fileserver.py on the on the remote machine which will hold the images of all the distributed systems
* Update the IP address of the file server machine in blockchain.py
* Run blockchain.py on the local machines or networked machines
* Open <+address of the machine on which blockchain.py is running>:5000 on the browser eg. http://localhost:5000
* ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/30/ffffff/f03c15?text=+hello) `#f03c15`
